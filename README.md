1) The GULAG System

What it was:
A sprawling network of forced-labor camps and penal colonies used to incarcerate criminals, political opponents, “class enemies,” and entire social groups. Beyond punishment, it was a mechanism of social control and an economic labor reservoir.

Underlying authority

One-party rule of the Communist Party fused with state power; Politburo control.

Secret police (GPU/OGPU → NKVD) with sweeping arrest powers; Article 58 (“counter-revolutionary activity”) as a catch-all offense.

Extra-judicial “troikas” issuing rapid sentences; bureaucratic quotas for arrests/executions.

Internal passport regime restricting movement; censorship and propaganda to justify repression.

Underlying economic resources

State monopoly over land, natural resources, rail, and industry allowed central planners to allocate captive labor to priority projects (canals, mines, logging, remote infrastructure).

Seizure of inmate property and unpaid labor reduced fiscal costs of megaprojects.

Remote regions (Siberia, Far North) supplied raw materials using coerced labor otherwise too costly to employ.

Other power dynamics

Rule by terror: fear of denunciation; incentivized informant networks.

Dehumanization of prisoners as “parasites/saboteurs,” legitimizing extreme exploitation.

Center–periphery asymmetry: Moscow ministries directing extraction from distant republics/oblasts with minimal local accountability.

2) Collectivization, Dekulakization & Special Settlements

What it was:
Forced consolidation of peasant farms into collectives (kolkhozy) and state farms (sovkhozy); liquidation and deportation of “kulaks” (often ordinary, modestly successful peasants); mass resettlement of targeted nationalities to “special settlements.”

Underlying authority

Central decrees mandating collectivization; NKVD/party activists empowered to requisition grain and enforce quotas.

Administrative courts and extra-judicial processes to label families “kulak” and seize assets.

Military and police reserved powers to carry out mass deportations.

Underlying economic resources

Confiscation of land, livestock, tools, seed, and stores; conversion into state-controlled productive assets.

Grain procurement and export provided foreign currency to finance rapid industrialization (machines, factories).

Forced resettlement created new labor pools (logging, mining, construction) in underpopulated regions.

Other power dynamics

Ideological “class war” framing enabled violence against neighbors; social envy weaponized.

Blacklisting/“blockade detachments” punished villages by cutting off trade for not meeting quotas.

Nationalities policy used to break perceived separatism; collective punishment normalized.

3) The Great Famine (1932–33, incl. Holodomor)

What it was:
A man-made famine resulting from aggressive grain requisitions, punitive quotas, market abolition, and movement restrictions—devastating Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other regions.

Underlying authority

Central plans set unrealistic procurements; failure branded as “sabotage.”

Orders to seal borders and restrict internal travel prevented flight to food-secure areas.

Suppression of famine reporting; criminalization of gleaning or “theft” of state grain.

Underlying economic resources

Grain exports and reserves prioritized industrialization and urban supply over rural survival.

Requisition apparatus (warehouses, railways) enabled systematic extraction from starving regions.

Confiscated foodstuffs, seed, and livestock redirected to state goals.

Other power dynamics

Differential punishment: blacklisted districts; targeted “class enemies” (kulaks) and perceived nationalist regions.

Information control—censorship and denial—obscured scale and blocked external relief.

Collective responsibility narratives blamed victims as “idlers” or “wreckers,” dulling resistance.

4) The Great Purge (1936–38)

What it was:
Mass arrests, show trials, executions, and camp sentences against party elites, military officers, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens—decapitating independent centers of power.

Underlying authority

NKVD operational orders (e.g., mass-operation directives) with numerical quotas for arrests/executions.

Show trials staged by the Procuracy; coerced confessions as legal theater.

Purge committees embedded across institutions; party membership used as both shield and trap.

Underlying economic resources

Confiscation of property of the condemned; labor of the condemned fed the camp economy.

Purge removed managers/experts, enabling political loyalty over competence in appointments—centralizing control of industrial plans despite inefficiency.

Other power dynamics

Paranoia as policy: ubiquitous surveillance, denunciation incentives, and self-policing.

Photo/archival manipulation to erase enemies; monopoly on historical narrative.

Military purges consolidated Stalin’s personal command but at catastrophic strategic cost.

5) Order No. 227 (“Not One Step Back!”, 1942)

What it was:
A wartime decree imposing blocking detachments, penal battalions, and on-the-spot executions to stop retreats during WWII.

Underlying authority

Supreme Command (Stavka) authority; NKVD blocking units empowered to shoot “cowards/panic-makers.”

Political commissars embedded in units to enforce ideological discipline.

Underlying economic resources

Manpower as expendable input: penal units thrown into high-casualty operations to conserve trained formations.

Command economy channeled logistics to prioritized fronts; scarcity amplified coercive discipline.

Other power dynamics

Total war mobilization fused military obedience with political loyalty.

Terror discipline substituted for training/equipment; collective punishment extended to families of “deserters” in earlier orders.

Propaganda framed sacrifice and fear as patriotic necessity.

6) Punishing Prisoners of War

What it was:
Returning Soviet POWs were filtered as potential traitors; many were imprisoned, sent to labor camps, or executed, with stigma extending to families.

Underlying authority

Directives (e.g., early-war orders) defining surrender as treason; SMERSH and NKVD filtration camps.

Legal presumption of guilt reversed burden of proof; military tribunals operated rapidly.

Underlying economic resources

Post-repatriation forced labor fed reconstruction and extraction sectors.

Confiscations and loss of benefits shifted economic burdens to victims and families.

Other power dynamics

Ideology of absolute loyalty inverts victimhood: POW status equated with betrayal.

Social ostracism and surveillance persisted after release, reinforcing compliance through fear.

The state’s control of records and employment foreclosed independent rehabilitation.

7) Giving a Pass to War Crimes

What it was:
Operational tolerance for atrocities (e.g., mass sexual violence, looting) by victorious forces; selective justice focused on enemy crimes, not one’s own.

Underlying authority

Prosecutorial non-enforcement and tacit directives prioritized victory and vengeance over accountability.

Censorship kept complaints out of public view; military courts emphasized discipline only when it threatened order.

Underlying economic resources

Plunder and seizures (equipment, rail stock, goods) folded into reparations and rebuilding.

Material incentives for troops (spoils, mailed parcels) turned a blind eye to abuses that accompanied looting.

Other power dynamics

Victor’s justice: international focus on Axis crimes enabled asymmetrical accountability.

Dehumanization of enemy populations in propaganda lowered moral barriers.

Chain-of-command culture discouraged reporting; survivors lacked channels for redress.

Cross-Cutting Enablers (System Map)

Monopolized Authority: One-party state; fusion of party, security services, and courts; leader cult that concentrated decision rights.

Legal Exceptionalism: Elastic criminal codes (e.g., “anti-Soviet agitation”), extra-judicial bodies, quotas, and emergency decrees normalized permanent exception.

Command Economy as Coercion Engine: State ownership of land/industry/transport allowed material leverage—food, housing, work assignments—as tools of discipline.

Security Apparatus: NKVD/secret police, informant networks, internal passports, filtration systems—surveillance at scale.

Information Control: Censorship, propaganda, archive manipulation, show trials—monopoly on truth.

Center–Periphery Extraction: Moscow ministries directing resources and people across vast distances; ethnic/national minorities disproportionately targeted.

War & Crisis Amplifiers: External threats and internal targets framed as existential, legitimizing expanded violence.

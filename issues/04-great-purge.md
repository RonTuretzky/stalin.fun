## Key Resource Flows

### Economic Resources
- **Confiscated property** of condemned feeding state budget
- **Forced labor** from condemned feeding camp economy
- **Vacated positions** filled by political loyalists
- **Industrial control** centralized despite inefficiency

### Authority Resources
- **NKVD operational orders** with arrest/execution quotas (e.g., Order 00447)
- **Show trial apparatus** providing legal theater
- **Purge committees** embedded across all institutions
- **Party membership** weaponized as trap and tool

### Power Dynamics
- **Paranoia as policy**: Ubiquitous surveillance and self-policing
- **Denunciation incentives**: Career advancement through betrayal
- **Photo/archival manipulation**: Monopoly on historical narrative
- **Military decapitation**: 3 of 5 marshals, 90% of generals eliminated
- **Cascading terror**: Each arrest triggering more through "connections"
- **Coerced confessions**: Torture producing "evidence" for more arrests

## Impact
- **750,000+ executed** in 1937-38 alone
- **Millions more** sent to GULAG camps
- **Military leadership destroyed** before WWII
- **Technical expertise eliminated** hampering development
- **Social atomization** through universal fear
- **Historical erasure** of victims from records
- **Institutional paralysis** from fear of initiative

# Issue: Punishing Prisoners of War - Complicit Parties and Resource Flows

## Key Resource Flows

### Human Resources Exploitation
- **Forced labor** from POWs for reconstruction
- **Labor battalions** for dangerous post-war work
- **GULAG expansion** with returning POWs
- **Loss of skilled workers** through persecution

### Authority Resources
- **Early-war orders** defining surrender as treason (Order 270)
- **SMERSH filtration authority** without oversight
- **Military tribunals** with presumption of guilt
- **NKVD surveillance apparatus** extended to families

### Power Dynamics
- **Inverted victimhood**: POW status equated with betrayal
- **Ideological purity test**: Survival itself suspicious
- **Burden of proof reversed**: Must prove innocence
- **Social control through stigma**: Permanent marking
- **Family collective punishment**: Guilt by association
- **State monopoly on records**: No independent rehabilitation
- **Employment gatekeeping**: Economic survival controlled

## Impact
- **1.5+ million POWs** subjected to filtration
- **~300,000 sent to GULAG** or execution
- **Remainder faced lifelong discrimination**
- **Families lost benefits and faced persecution**
- **Psychological trauma** from victim-blaming
- **Social atomization** through fear of association
- **Lost expertise** from persecution of officers/specialists
- **Generational stigma** affecting children of POWs

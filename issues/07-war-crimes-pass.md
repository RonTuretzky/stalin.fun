## Key Resource Flows

### Material Plunder
- **Industrial equipment** seized as "reparations"
- **Rail stock and infrastructure** taken wholesale
- **Personal property** looted and mailed home
- **Agricultural assets** stripped from occupied territories
- **Cultural artifacts** stolen systematically

### Authority Non-Enforcement
- **Prosecutorial discretion** to ignore Soviet crimes
- **Military court inaction** on reported atrocities
- **Command tolerance** for "revenge" actions
- **Censorship apparatus** suppressing complaints

### Power Dynamics
- **Victor's justice**: International focus on Axis crimes only
- **Dehumanization propaganda**: Enemy civilians as legitimate targets
- **Material incentives**: Looting as troop compensation
- **Chain-of-command culture**: Discouraging crime reporting
- **No survivor recourse**: Victims lack justice channels
- **Asymmetrical accountability**: Own crimes ignored
- **"Liberation" narrative**: Crimes hidden behind heroic framing

## Impact
- **2+ million German women** sexually assaulted
- **Countless civilians murdered** without accountability
- **Mass trauma** across occupied populations
- **Systematic economic stripping** of occupied territories
- **Justice denied** to victims
- **Precedent set** for military impunity
- **Historical denial** through censorship
- **Intergenerational trauma** from unacknowledged crimes
- **Poisoned post-war relations** with occupied nations
